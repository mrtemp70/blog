The **`never`** type represents values that never occur. It is used for functions that either throw an error or run indefinitely, meaning they never complete or return a value.

### Example 1: Function that Throws an Error

```typescript
function error(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);  // The function doesn't return, it throws an error
}
```

- A function that throws an error has the return type **`never`**, because it never completes successfully or returns a value.

### Example 2: Inferred Return Type of `never`

```typescript
function fail() {
  return error("Something failed");  // Inferred return type is `never`
}
```

- The return type of `fail` is inferred as **`never`** because it calls `error`, which never completes.

### Example 3: Infinite Loop

```typescript
function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {}  // Infinite loop, function never ends
}
```

- A function with an infinite loop also has a **`never`** return type because it never finishes and never returns a value.

### Key Points:

- **`never`** is used for functions that never return, either because they throw an error or run indefinitely.
- A function with a **`never`** return type has an unreachable endpoint and will not complete its execution normally.
