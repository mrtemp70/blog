### TypeScript Overview

- **TypeScript** is a **typed superset** of **JavaScript** that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Object-Oriented**: TypeScript is **OOP**-based, with classes, interfaces, and static typing, similar to languages like **C#** or **Java**.
- **Angular**: The **Angular 2.0** framework is written in TypeScript. TypeScript was developed by **Microsoft** and is open-source. **React** and **React Native** are developed by **Meta**.
- **JavaScript**: Initially for client-side, JavaScript became a server-side technology with **Node.js**.
- **Compilation**: TypeScript is a **compiled** language, strongly typed and supports **OOP** (since 2012).
- **JavaScript Compatibility**: TypeScript is ultimately just **JavaScript**. All TypeScript code compiles to JavaScript.

### Language Types

1. **Strongly Typed / Statically Typed**:
    - **Examples**: C, C#, Java, TypeScript
    - **Syntax**: `int num = 10;` (requires datatype declaration)
2. **Loosely Typed / Weakly Typed**:
    - **Examples**: JavaScript, PHP

### TypeScript Layers

1. **Language**
2. **TypeScript Compiler**
3. **TypeScript Language Services**

### Key Differences: TypeScript vs JavaScript

- **TypeScript** is a **strongly typed** and **OOP**-supported language.
- **JavaScript** is a **scripting language** with no static typing.

### TypeScript Drawbacks

1. **Compilation Time**: TypeScript takes longer to compile.
2. **Abstract Classes**: TypeScript does not support abstract classes (in some cases).
