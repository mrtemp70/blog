An **interface** in TypeScript is used to define the shape of an object. It can specify the properties and methods that an object must have, but it doesn't provide the implementation.

### Example 1: Basic Interface

```typescript
function printLabel(labeledObj: { label: string }) {
  console.log(labeledObj.label);
}

let myObj = { size: 10, label: "Size 10 Object" };
printLabel(myObj);
```

- This function accepts an object with a `label` property, but it's defined inline.
- You can improve this with an interface.

### Example 2: Using an Interface to Define Object Shape

```typescript
interface LabeledValue {
  label: string;
}

function printLabel(labeledObj: LabeledValue) {
  console.log(labeledObj.label);
}

let myObj = { size: 10, label: "Size 10 Object" };
printLabel(myObj);
```

- The interface **`LabeledValue`** defines the shape of the object that is expected, ensuring it has a `label` property.
- The function `printLabel` now expects an object of type `LabeledValue`.

### Example 3: Extending Interfaces

```typescript
interface IPerson {
  name: string;
  gender: string;
}

interface IEmployee extends IPerson {
  empCode: number;
}

let empObj: IEmployee = {
  empCode: 1,
  name: "Bill",
  gender: "Male"
};
```

- **`IEmployee`** extends the **`IPerson`** interface, meaning it inherits the properties of `IPerson` and adds its own (`empCode`).
- This shows how interfaces can be extended to create more complex types.

### Example 4: Implementing an Interface in a Class

```typescript
interface IEmployee {
  empCode: number;
  name: string;
  getSalary: (empCode: number) => number;
}

class Employee implements IEmployee {
  empCode: number;
  name: string;

  constructor(code: number, name: string) {
    this.empCode = code;
    this.name = name;
  }

  getSalary(empCode: number): number {
    return 20000;
  }
}

let emp = new Employee(1, "Steve");
```

- The **`IEmployee`** interface defines the structure that the **`Employee`** class must adhere to.
- The class **`Employee`** implements the interface, providing the `empCode`, `name`, and `getSalary` method.

### Key Points:

1. **Interfaces** define the structure of an object, including its properties and methods.
2. Interfaces can be extended to create more complex types by inheriting properties and methods from other interfaces.
3. **Classes** can implement interfaces, ensuring the class adheres to the structure defined by the interface.
