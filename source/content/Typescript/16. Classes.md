A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (properties) and functionality (methods).

### Example 1: Defining a Class

```typescript
class Greeter {
  greeting: string;

  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }

  greet() {
    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
  }
}

let greeter = new Greeter("world");
```

- **`greeting`** is a class property.
- The **`constructor`** initializes the object with a **`message`** that gets assigned to the `greeting` property.
- **`greet`** is a method that returns a greeting message using the `greeting` property.

### Key Points:

1. **Class Definition**: A class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by its name (`Greeter`).
2. **Constructor**: The **`constructor`** method is a special method used to initialize new objects. It is called when creating an instance using `new`.
3. **Methods**: The class can have methods like **`greet()`** that define the behavior of the class.
4. **Instance Creation**: The `new Greeter("world")` creates a new instance of the `Greeter` class, passing `"world"` to the constructor.
