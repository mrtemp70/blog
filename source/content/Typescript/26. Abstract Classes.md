An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes to extend. Abstract classes can contain both **abstract methods** (which must be implemented in derived classes) and **regular methods** (which can be shared among derived classes).

### Example: Abstract Classes

```typescript
// Abstract class with abstract and regular methods
abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void; // Abstract method - must be implemented in derived classes

  move(): void {
    console.log("roaming the earth...");
  }
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Abstract Methods**: These methods are declared in the abstract class but do not have an implementation. The derived class must implement these methods.
2. **Regular Methods**: Abstract classes can also have regular methods that provide a default implementation, which can be inherited by derived classes.

### Example 2: Abstract Class with a Subclass

```typescript
abstract class Department {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  printName(): void {
    console.log("Department name: " + this.name);
  }

  abstract printMeeting(): void; // Abstract method - must be implemented in derived classes
}

// Subclass extending abstract class
class AccountingDepartment extends Department {
  constructor() {
    super("Accounting and Auditing"); // Must call `super()` in derived class
  }

  printMeeting(): void {
    console.log("The Accounting Department meets each Monday at 10am.");
  }

  generateReports(): void {
    console.log("Generating accounting reports...");
  }
}

// Trying to instantiate an abstract class (This will throw an error)
let department: Department; // Allowed to create a reference to an abstract class
// department = new Department(); // Error: Cannot create an instance of an abstract class
department = new AccountingDepartment(); // Correct: Can create an instance of a subclass
department.printName();
department.printMeeting();
// department.generateReports(); // Error: method doesn't exist on the abstract type
```

### Key Points in the Example:

1. **Abstract Class `Department`**:
    
    - The `Department` class has a regular method (`printName`) and an abstract method (`printMeeting`).
    - The `printMeeting` method must be implemented by any class that extends `Department`.
2. **Subclass `AccountingDepartment`**:
    
    - The `AccountingDepartment` class implements the abstract `printMeeting` method and adds its own method `generateReports`.
    - `AccountingDepartment` can be instantiated, while `Department` cannot because it is abstract.
3. **Abstract Method Implementation**:
    
    - Abstract methods like `printMeeting` must be implemented in derived classes. If a derived class doesn't implement them, it will result in a compilation error.

### Example Usage:

- **Instantiating**: You cannot directly create an instance of an abstract class like `Department` (e.g., `department = new Department();` would cause an error). Instead, you instantiate the derived class `AccountingDepartment`.
- **Calling Methods**: Once an instance of a concrete subclass is created, you can call both the abstract and regular methods. For example, calling `department.printName()` works, but calling `department.generateReports()` results in an error because the abstract reference type doesn't include `generateReports`.
