In TypeScript, **interfaces** are often used to define the structure of an object. Interestingly, **classes** can also be used to define the shape or structure of an object, which can be used in place of an interface. This concept is called **"Using a class as an interface"**.

### Example: Using a Class as an Interface

```typescript
// Define a class with properties
class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;

  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}

// Extend the class with an interface to add another property
interface Point3d extends Point {
  z: number;
}

// Creating an object with the structure of Point3d
let point3d: Point3d = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 };

console.log(point3d); // Output: { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }
```

### Key Points:

1. **Class `Point`**:
    
    - This class defines two properties: `x` and `y`.
    - A constructor is used to initialize these properties when an object of `Point` is created.
2. **Interface `Point3d`**:
    
    - The interface `Point3d` extends from the class `Point`, meaning it must include all properties of `Point` (i.e., `x` and `y`).
    - It also includes an additional property `z`, making it a 3D point.
3. **Object `point3d`**:
    
    - The object `point3d` is created with properties `x`, `y`, and `z`, satisfying the structure of `Point3d`, which extends `Point`.



This approach can be useful when you want to enforce the structure of objects while leveraging the benefits of class implementation (e.g., methods) in conjunction with interfaces.
