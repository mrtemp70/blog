Decorators in TypeScript provide a way to modify or enhance the behavior of classes, methods, properties, or parameters. They are a special kind of function that can be attached to classes or their members.

Decorators are experimental in TypeScript, so you need to enable them explicitly using the `--experimentalDecorators` compiler flag.

#### **Steps to Enable Decorators**:

1. **Command Line**: Use the `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) command with the `--experimentalDecorators` flag.
    
    ```bash
    tsc --target ES5 --experimentalDecorators
    ```
    
2. **tsconfig.json**: Alternatively, enable decorators in the TypeScript configuration file.
    
    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES5",
        "experimentalDecorators": true
      }
    }
    ```

#### **Example with Decorators**:

In this example, we'll define two decorators, `f` and `g`, and apply them to a method in a class.

```typescript
function f() {
  console.log("f(): evaluated");
  return function(target, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    console.log("f(): called");
  };
}

function g() {
  console.log("g(): evaluated");
  return function(target, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    console.log("g(): called");
  };
}

class C {
  @f()
  @g()
  method() {}
}
```

### **Explanation**:

- **Decorator `f`**:
    
    - When applied to the method `method()`, it prints `f(): evaluated` during evaluation.
    - It then returns a function that prints `f(): called` when invoked.
- **Decorator `g`**:
    
    - Similarly, it prints `g(): evaluated` during evaluation.
    - It also returns a function that prints `g(): called`.
- **Class `C`**:
    
    - The `method()` is decorated with both `@f()` and `@g()` decorators.
    - The decorators are evaluated in the order they are applied, from bottom to top (`@f()` first, then `@g()`).

### **Output**:

When the class `C` is used and `method()` is called, the following output will be printed:

```
f(): evaluated
g(): evaluated
f(): called
g(): called
```

Decorators in TypeScript are powerful tools to modify the behavior of classes, methods, and properties dynamically. They can be used in frameworks like Angular for things like dependency injection or routing.
