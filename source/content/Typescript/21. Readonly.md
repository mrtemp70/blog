In TypeScript, the `readonly` modifier makes a property **immutable**. Once a property is set, it cannot be reassigned after the object has been created. This is useful for creating constant properties that should not be modified.

### Example: `readonly` Properties

```typescript
class Octopus {
  readonly name: string;  // readonly property
  readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;  // readonly property with default value

  constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

let dad = new Octopus("Man with the 8 strong legs");
dad.name = "Man with the 3-piece suit";  // Error: 'name' is readonly
```

### Key Points:

1. **`readonly`** makes a property **immutable** after initialization.
2. Once a `readonly` property is set in the constructor (or through its default value), it **cannot be reassigned**.
3. Attempting to reassign a `readonly` property (like `dad.name = "new name"`) will result in a **compilation error**.
