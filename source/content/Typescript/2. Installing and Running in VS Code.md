**Topic: Installing TypeScript and Running it in VS Code**

1. Install TypeScript globally by running the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    npm install --save-dev typescript        // install project only
    ```
    
    Verify installation with:
    
    ```bash
    tsc -v
    ```
    
2. Create a folder on your computer and inside it, create a file named `app.ts`.
    
3. In the terminal, run:
    
    ```bash
    tsc app.ts
    ```
    
    This will generate an `app.js` file in the same folder.
    
4. Create an `index.html` file in the same folder, and add the following code to link the generated JavaScript file:
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    

Now you can open `index.html` in a browser to see the result.

**Optional:**  Enhance the TypeScript workflow in VS Code with these extensions:

1. **ESLint**: Provides linting for TypeScript to catch errors and improve code quality.
    
2. **Prettier**: Automatically formats your code for consistency and readability.
    
3. **Debugger for Chrome**: Allows you to debug TypeScript code directly in the browser from VS Code.
