**Type Assertions** allow you to tell TypeScript to treat a variable as a specific type, overriding its inferred type. It's similar to type casting in other languages, but without any special checking or restructuring.

### Example 1: Basic Type Assertion

```typescript
let someValue: any = "this is a string";
let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;
```

- Here, `someValue` is of type **`any`**, but we know it's a string, so we assert it as a **`string`** using `<string>someValue`.
- Then we access the `length` property, which TypeScript knows is valid for a string.

### Example 2: Using `as` Syntax (alternative to `<string>`)

```typescript
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
```

- The **`as`** syntax is the alternative to the `<type>` syntax and is preferred in **JSX/TSX** files (for React).

### Key Points:

- **Type assertions** are used to tell TypeScript the specific type of a variable when TypeScript cannot infer it automatically.
- **`<type>value`** and **`value as type`** are two ways to write type assertions.
- Type assertions do **not** perform any runtime checks; they just tell TypeScript to treat the value as a specified type.
