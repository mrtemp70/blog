TypeScript provides three main **accessibility modifiers** to control the visibility of class members (properties and methods):

1. **`public`**
2. **`private`**
3. **`protected`**

### 1. **`public`**: Accessible Everywhere

By default, all members of a class are **public**. This means they can be accessed from anywhere.

### Example 1: Public Members

```typescript
class Animal {
  public name: string;

  public constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }

  public move(distanceInMeters: number) {
    console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
  }
}

let dog = new Animal("Dog");
console.log(dog.name);   // OK, because 'name' is public
dog.move(10);            // OK, because 'move' is public
```

- **`public`** allows the property or method to be accessed from anywhere.

### 2. **`private`**: Accessible Only Within the Class

A **`private`** member can only be accessed within the class where it's defined. It cannot be accessed from outside or from derived classes.

### Example 2: Private Members

```typescript
class Animal {
  private name: string;

  constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

new Animal("Cat").name;  // Error: 'name' is private and cannot be accessed
```

- **`private`** prevents external access to the member. Trying to access `name` directly from outside results in an error.

### 3. **`protected`**: Accessible Within the Class and Its Subclasses

A **`protected`** member can be accessed within the class where it’s defined and by instances of classes that inherit from it (subclasses).

### Example 3: Protected Members

```typescript
class Person {
  protected name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  private department: string;

  constructor(name: string, department: string) {
    super(name);
    this.department = department;
  }

  public getElevatorPitch() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;
  }
}

let howard = new Employee("Howard", "Sales");
console.log(howard.getElevatorPitch());  // OK, 'name' is accessible in Employee
console.log(howard.name);               // Error: 'name' is protected, not accessible outside Employee
```

- **`protected`** allows access in the class and its subclasses, but not from outside.

### 4. **Inheritance with Access Modifiers**

Inheritance works with these access modifiers:

- **`private`** members are not inherited and cannot be accessed from derived classes.
- **`protected`** members can be inherited and accessed within the derived class.

### Example 4: Inheritance with `private` and `protected`

```typescript
class Animal {
  private name: string;

  constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

class Rhino extends Animal {
  constructor() {
    super("Rhino");
  }
}

let animal = new Animal("Goat");
let rhino = new Rhino();

animal = rhino;  // OK: Animal and Rhino are compatible, but 'name' is private in Animal
```

- You cannot assign `animal = employee` because `Animal` and `Employee` are not compatible types due to the private `name` property in `Animal`.

### 5. **Access Modifiers in Constructors**

Constructors can also have **access modifiers** to control how class properties are initialized and whether they can be accessed outside the class.

### Example 5: Constructor with `protected`

```typescript
class Person {
  protected name: string;

  protected constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  private department: string;

  constructor(name: string, department: string) {
    super(name);
    this.department = department;
  }

  public getElevatorPitch() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;
  }
}
```

- The constructor of **`Person`** is **`protected`**, so it cannot be called directly outside of the class but can be accessed in subclasses like **`Employee`**.

### Key Points:

1. **`public`** members can be accessed from anywhere.
2. **`private`** members are only accessible within the class and cannot be accessed by derived classes.
3. **`protected`** members can be accessed within the class and its subclasses.
4. **Constructors** can also be marked with `public`, `private`, or `protected` to control how they can be called.
