In TypeScript, the number type is quite flexible and can represent several kinds of numeric values, but there are no distinct "types" for each kind of number (e.g., integers, floats). TypeScript simply has one `number` type, which can represent:

1. **Decimal numbers** (base 10)
2. **Hexadecimal numbers** (base 16, starting with `0x`)
3. **Binary numbers** (base 2, starting with `0b`)
4. **Octal numbers** (base 8, starting with `0o`)

TypeScript doesn't differentiate between these kinds of numbers in terms of type, but it allows you to represent them in various forms.

Here’s a summary of the types of numeric literals that can be represented in TypeScript:

### Types of Numbers in TypeScript

1. **Decimal Numbers** (base 10):
    
    ```typescript
    let decimal: number = 42;
    ```
    
2. **Hexadecimal Numbers** (base 16, prefixed with `0x`):
    
    ```typescript
    let hex: number = 0x2A;  // Equivalent to decimal 42
    ```
    
3. **Binary Numbers** (base 2, prefixed with `0b`):
    
    ```typescript
    let binary: number = 0b101010;  // Equivalent to decimal 42
    ```
    
4. **Octal Numbers** (base 8, prefixed with `0o`):
    
    ```typescript
    let octal: number = 0o52;  // Equivalent to decimal 42
    ```
    
5. **Floating-Point Numbers** (representing decimals, not specifically limited to an integer):
    
    ```typescript
    let float: number = 3.14;
    ```
    
6. **Special Number Values**:
    
    - **Infinity**: A special constant representing infinity.
        
        ```typescript
        let infinite: number = Infinity;
        ```
        
    - **NaN** (Not-a-Number): Represents an invalid number result.
        
        ```typescript
        let invalidNumber: number = NaN;
        ```
        

### Example with All Types

```typescript
let decimal: number = 42;
let hex: number = 0x2A;
let binary: number = 0b101010;
let octal: number = 0o52;
let float: number = 3.14;
let infinite: number = Infinity;
let invalidNumber: number = NaN;
```
