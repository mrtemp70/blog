**Domain driven design:** (এটি)  Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development methodology that focuses on creating software systems that are based on a deep understanding of the business domain. The approach was introduced by Eric Evans in his book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" in 2003. In DDD, the business domain is the primary focus of the development process. The goal is to create a software system that models the domain and its concepts accurately and effectively. This is done through the use of domain modeling, which is the process of creating a shared understanding of the domain concepts and their relationships.

DDD also emphasizes the use of ubiquitous language, which is a language that is shared by all stakeholders in the project, including developers, business analysts, and domain experts. This language is used to describe the domain concepts and their relationships in a way that is easy to understand by all stakeholders. DDD also includes the use of patterns and techniques that are specifically designed to address the complexities of the domain. These patterns include aggregates, entities, value objects, repositories, and services.

Overall, the goal of DDD is to create software systems that are more closely aligned with the business domain, and that can evolve more easily over time as the domain changes.
