The `HAVING` clause in SQL is used to filter groups of data after an aggregation operation. Unlike the `WHERE` clause, which filters rows before grouping, the `HAVING` clause applies conditions to aggregated data. ==In aggregation operations like SUM(), MAX() and etc, the WHERE clause does not worked. That's why we use HAVING to perform the same function as WHERE in MS SQL.==

- **Syntax**:

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
    FROM table_name
    GROUP BY column_name
    HAVING condition;
    ```

### **Example**

|Product|Amount|
|---|---|
|Pen|200|
|Notebook|150|
|Marker|350|
|Pen|300|
|Notebook|200|
|Marker|100|

```sql
SELECT Product, SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(Amount) > 500;
```

#### **Output**:

| Product | TotalSales |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Pen     | 500        |
| Marker  | 450        |
