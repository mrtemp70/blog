### **SQL Cursor Example**

```sql
DECLARE @name VARCHAR(50);

DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR 
SELECT name FROM Employees;

OPEN cur;
FETCH NEXT FROM cur INTO @name;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT @name;
    FETCH NEXT FROM cur INTO @name;
END;

CLOSE cur;
DEALLOCATE cur;
```

### Steps Explained:

1. Declare a variable (`@name`) to store data from the cursor.
2. Declare the cursor (`cur`) for a `SELECT` query.
3. Open the cursor.
4. Fetch the first row into the variable.
5. Use a `WHILE` loop to iterate through all rows.
6. Close and deallocate the cursor after use.

### When to Use Cursors?

- When you need to process each row individually.
- When set-based operations are not possible or too complex.
- When working with procedural logic inside SQL.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Cursors can be slow for large datasets. Try to use set-based operations whenever possible.
