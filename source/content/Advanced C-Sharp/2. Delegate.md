**Delegate:** A method can be passed as a parameter to another method through a delegate. If we create a bubble sort method, we cannot change the main code of the bubble sort; instead, we can pass new conditions as parameters to the bubble sort method.

A delegate is a variable that holds a reference to a method. You can also think of it as a pointer to a function. A delegate can refer to more than one method with the same return type and parameters.

**When and why to use delegate?**

When we need to pass a method as a parameter

``` csharp
delegate int Calculator(int x, int y);

class Program
{
    public static int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }

    public static int Mul(int x, int y)
    {
        return x * y;
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Calculator c1 = Add;
        int result = c1(10, 20); 
        Console.WriteLine(result); // 30
    }
}
```

·  There are many type of delegate exists. Here is some examples:

| Delegate Type          | Description                                              | Example                                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Action                 | Method with parameters, no return value                  | Action, Action<T>, Action<T1, ..., T16>                 |
| Func                   | Method with parameters, returns a value                  | Func<TResult>, Func<T, TResult>, Func<T1, ..., TResult> |
| Predicate              | Special case of Func<T, bool> for boolean conditions     | Predicate<T>                                            |
| Comparison             | Method for comparing two objects for ordering            | Comparison<T>                                           |
| EventHandler           | Method that handles an event                             | EventHandler, EventHandler<TEventArgs>                  |
| Converter              | Method that converts one type to another                 | Converter<TInput, TOutput>                              |
| Action<T1, ..., T16>   | Method with up to 16 parameters, no return value         | -                                                       |
| Func<T1, ..., TResult> | Method with up to 16 parameters, returns a value         | -                                                       |
| MulticastDelegate      | Base class for delegates supporting multicast invocation | -                                                       |

·         Example **Func** and **Action**: (We can’t use params keyword in Func and Action)
``` csharp
// Func (A type of delegate)
Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;
int result = add(5, 10); // Result is 15

// Action (A type of delegate)
Action<string> printMessage = (message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
printMessage("Hello, World!"); // Outputs: Hello, World!
```

## **More Details on Delegates & Events**

### **Why Use Delegates?**

Programmers often need to pass a method as a parameter to another method. Delegates are created for this purpose.  Delegates were introduced in C# 1.0. In C#, a delegate encapsulates a method signature, and although it can be used in many contexts, it is often fundamental in event-handling models.

### **What is a Delegate?**

In simple terms, a delegate holds references to methods and can invoke them when needed. You can attach multiple methods to a delegate and invoke them collectively.

### **Benefits of Delegates**

1. **Object-Oriented**: Delegates are type-safe and secure.
2. **Simplified Event Handling**: Makes managing events straightforward.
3. **Parameter Passing**: Allows methods to be passed as parameters.
4. **Callback Mechanism**: Useful for implementing callback methods.
5. **Encapsulation**: Provides a clean way to encapsulate methods.
6. **Event Handling**: Primarily used for events and callbacks.
7. **Anonymous Methods**: Enables invocation of anonymous methods.

### **How to Define a Delegate***

1. **Declare a Delegate**: Define the delegate type.
2. **Assign a Target Method**: Attach methods to the delegate.
3. **Invoke the Delegate**: Call the methods through the delegate.

### **Types of Delegates in**

1. **Single Delegate**: Points to one method at a time.
2. **Multicast Delegate**: Points to multiple methods.
3. **Generic Delegate**: Used for generic types and methods.

### **Understanding Events**

In C#, an event allows one object to notify other objects about specific actions or conditions. Events are implemented using delegates to define event handlers.

### **Example: Delegates and Events in Action**

```csharp
using System;

// Define a delegate type
delegate void MyDelegate(string message);

class Publisher
{
    // Declare an event based on the delegate
    public event MyDelegate OnPublish;

    public void PublishNews(string news)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Publishing news: " + news);

        // Trigger the event if there are subscribers
        OnPublish?.Invoke(news);
    }
}

class Subscriber
{
    public void Subscribe(Publisher publisher)
    {
        // Add method to the event delegate
        publisher.OnPublish += DisplayNews;
    }

    public void Unsubscribe(Publisher publisher)
    {
        // Remove method from the event delegate
        publisher.OnPublish -= DisplayNews;
    }

    // Event handler method
    void DisplayNews(string news)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Received news: " + news);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Publisher newsPublisher = new Publisher();
        Subscriber subscriber1 = new Subscriber();
        Subscriber subscriber2 = new Subscriber();

        // Subscribers subscribe to the event
        subscriber1.Subscribe(newsPublisher);
        subscriber2.Subscribe(newsPublisher);

        // Publish news
        newsPublisher.PublishNews("Thanks for subscribing!");

        // Unsubscribe one subscriber
        subscriber1.Unsubscribe(newsPublisher);

        // Publish more news
        newsPublisher.PublishNews("Stay informed with more updates!");
    }
}
```

### **Output**

```
Publishing news: Thanks for subscribing!
Received news: Thanks for subscribing!
Received news: Thanks for subscribing!
Publishing news: Stay informed with more updates!
Received news: Stay informed with more updates!
```
