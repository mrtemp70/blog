A partial class in C# allows a single class to be divided into multiple files, enabling developers to organize and maintain large code bases more effectively. Must have partial keyword (no class name like `public class MyClass` supported).

``` csharp
public partial class MyClass
{
    public void Print1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Print 1");
    }
}

public partial class MyClass
{
    public void Print2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Print 2");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.Print1();
        myClass.Print2();
    }
}
```

Advantages of Partial Classes:
1. Split UI design and business logic easily.
2. No need to regenerate source files for auto-generated files.
3. Facilitates concurrent development by multiple developers.
4. Easier maintenance and development of large classes by breaking them into smaller, manageable partial classes.
