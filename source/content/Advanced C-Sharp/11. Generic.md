In C#, generics provide a way to create classes, structures, interfaces, and methods with placeholders for the data types they operate on. ==Generics allow you to design flexible and reusable components while maintaining type safety.== Generics constraints further enhance the capabilities of generics by specifying limitations on the types that can be used with a generic type or method.

``` csharp
public class Box<T>
{
    private T value;

    public Box(T value)
    {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public T GetValue()
    {
        return value;
    }
}
```
