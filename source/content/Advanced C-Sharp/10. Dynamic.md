In C#, the dynamic keyword is a type that represents an object whose operations will be resolved at runtime rather than at compile time.

``` csharp
dynamic dynamicVariable = 10; // Implicitly becomes an int
Console.WriteLine(dynamicVariable); // Outputs: 10

dynamicVariable = "Hello, Dynamic!"; // Implicitly becomes a string
Console.WriteLine(dynamicVariable); // Outputs: Hello, Dynamic!
```


| Feature             | dynamic                                                    | object                                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Type Checking       | Resolved at runtime, no compile-time type checking         | Compile-time type checking                           |
| Implicit Typing     | Type is determined implicitly at runtime                   | Explicitly declared type                             |
| Late Binding        | Yes                                                        | No                                                   |
| Compile-Time Safety | Less safe due to deferred type checking                    | Compile-time safety ensured                          |
| Method Invocation   | Resolved at runtime, allows flexibility in method calls    | Compile-time method invocation with explicit casting |
| Property Access     | Resolved at runtime, allows flexibility in property access | Compile-time property access with explicit casting   |
| Nullability         | Can represent null                                         | Can represent null                                   |
| Performance         | Potentially slower due to runtime type resolution          | Generally faster due to compile-time type resolution |
