(Must read this link or search other link: [https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/c-sharp-tutorial/c-sharp-interview-questions](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/c-sharp-tutorial/c-sharp-interview-questions)). In below we write some important question from upper link:

**1. What is C#?**

C# is an object-oriented programming language compiled by the .NET framework to generate Microsoft Intermediate Language.

Can multiple catch blocks be executed?

No, you cannot execute multiple catch blocks of the same type.

**2. What is the difference between static, public, and void?**

Public declared variables can be accessed from anywhere in the application.

Static declared variables can be accessed globally without needing to create an instance of the class.

Void is a type modifier which states the method and is used to specify the return type of a method in C#.

**3. What is an object?**

An object is a class instance that can be used to access class methods. The "New" keyword can be used to construct an object.

**4.** **Define Constructors.**

A constructor is a member function with the same name as its class. It is automatically invoked when an object is created and initializes all data members.

**5. What are Jagged Arrays?**

Arrays comprising elements of type array are called Jagged Arrays. They can have elements of various dimensions and sizes.

**6. What is the difference between out and ref parameters?**

When an argument is passed as a ref, it must be initialized before passing to the method.

An out parameter need not be initialized before passing to a method.

**7. What is the benefit of ‘using’ statement in C#?**

The ‘using’ statement is used to obtain a resource for processing before automatically disposing it when execution is completed.

**8. What is serialization?**

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes for transport through a network.

**9. Can “this” command be used within a static method?**

No, "this" command cannot be used within a static method.

**10. Differentiate between Break and Continue Statement.**

Continue statement: Used to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Break statement: Used to exit the loop immediately.

**29. What is method overloading?**

Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.

**30. What is the difference between ArrayList and Array?**

==An array has a fixed size and can only contain elements of the same type,== while an ==ArrayList can dynamically grow in size== and can contain elements of different types.

**31. Is it possible for a private virtual method to be overridden?**

No, a private virtual method cannot be overridden as it is not accessible outside the class.

Methods can be overloaded by using different data types, different orders, or different numbers of parameters.

**47. Why can't the accessibility modifier (public, private, internal, protected) be specified for methods within the interface?**

All methods in an interface are implicitly public because they are meant to be overridden in derived classes.

**48. How can we set the class to be inherited, but prevent the method from being overridden?** The class needs to be declared as public, and the method needs to be sealed.

**49. What happens if the method names in the inherited interfaces conflict?**

There may be conflicts if the methods expect different data types, but the compiler should handle this without issue.

**50. What is the difference between a Struct and a Class?**

Indexers provide a way to access elements of a collection or class as if they were arrays, enabling convenient and intuitive access to internal data structures without exposing them directly.

You would use an indexer instead of directly using an array when you want to encapsulate the data structure within a class, providing controlled access and potentially adding additional functionality or validation beyond simple array access.

**56. What is the distinction between "throw" and "throw ex" in .NET?**

=="throw" retains the original error stack, while "throw ex" keeps the stack trace from the throw point.==

**57. What are C# attributes and their significance?**

**78. What do you understand about Get and Set Accessor properties?**

Get and Set accessors are used to control access to class fields, providing encapsulation.

**79. What is the Race condition in C#?**

A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data and try to change it at the same time.

**80. Why are Async and Await used in C#?**

Async and Await keywords are used for asynchronous programming, allowing non-blocking execution of tasks.

**81. What is an Indexer in C#?**

An indexer is a property that allows accessing elements of a class using array-like syntax. (ক্লাসের এলিমেন্টকে এ্যারের মতো ব্যবহার করতে দেয়)।

XSD (XML Schema Definition) defines the structure of XML data.

**84. What are I/O classes in C#?**

I/O classes in C# are used for file operations like creation, deletion, reading, and writing.

**85. What exactly do you mean by regular expressions in C#?**

Regular expressions are patterns used for matching strings, offering powerful text processing capabilities.

**86. Why we use `Exception` in a catch block in C# instead of `ex`?**

In C#, using `catch (Exception)` without `ex` (the variable) is when you don't need details about the exception but still want to handle it (e.g., cleanup). If you rethrow with `throw;` (not `throw ex;`), it preserves the original exception's stack trace. Omitting `ex` avoids accidentally modifying or resetting the stack trace (which happens if you use `throw ex;`). Use `catch (Exception ex)` only if you need to log or inspect the exception before rethrowing.
`Catch(Exception) { throw; }`.

|Default constructor|Do not have permission to create any default constructor|You can create a default constructor|

**32. IList vs List**

`IList` and `List` are both interfaces and classes in C# that are used for collections, but they serve different purposes:

1. **`IList` Interface:**

   - `IList` stands for "Indexed List" and is part of the `System.Collections` namespace.

   - It represents a non-generic collection of objects that can be individually accessed by index.

   - It defines methods to add, remove, and retrieve elements at specified positions in the list.

   - `IList` is implemented by several classes in .NET, including `ArrayList`, `CollectionBase`, etc.

   - It is the base interface for arrays and lists in .NET.

2. **`List` Class:**

   - `List` is a generic collection class in C# and is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace.

   - It is an implementation of the `IList<T>` generic interface.

   - `List` provides a strongly-typed collection of objects, meaning you can specify the type of elements it can hold when you instantiate it.

   - It offers similar functionality to `IList` but with type safety, improved performance, and syntax enhancements due to being strongly-typed.

   - `List` provides methods like `Add`, `Remove`, `Contains`, `IndexOf`, etc., for manipulating the collection.

Here's a summary of the differences:

- `IList` is an interface, while `List` is a concrete class.

- `IList` is not type-safe (it predates generics), while `List` is strongly-typed due to being a generic class.

- `List` provides more functionality out of the box and is preferred for most scenarios where a generic list is needed.

- `IList` is more generic and can be useful when dealing with different implementations of lists or when needing to accept various types of lists as method parameters.

In general, if you're working with a specific type of list and type safety is important, it's preferable to use `List<T>`. However, if you're designing a method or class that needs to accept various types of lists, `IList` might be more appropriate.

**33. Strongly-typed vs not type-safe**

Apologies for any confusion. Let me clarify the terms "strongly-typed" and "not type-safe":

1. **Strongly-Typed:**

   - In a strongly-typed language like C#, every variable and expression has a type known at compile time.

   - Strong typing helps catch errors at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

   - For example, when you declare a variable of type `int`, you can only assign integer values to it. This type safety prevents you from assigning incompatible types, like a string, to that variable.

   - `List<T>` is strongly-typed because it allows you to specify the type of elements it holds (`T`). This means the compiler can enforce type safety, ensuring that you only add, remove, or manipulate elements of the specified type.

2. **Not Type-Safe:**

   - When we say something is not type-safe, it means the language or construct doesn't ensure type correctness at compile time.

   - `IList`, being a non-generic interface, is not type-safe because it operates on `object` references rather than specific types.

   - For example, when you use `IList`, you can add any object to the list without any compile-time checks on the type. This can lead to runtime errors if you attempt to retrieve an item and cast it to an incompatible type.

   - Due to its lack of type safety, using `IList` might result in more runtime errors compared to `List<T>`, where type safety is enforced by the compiler.

So, to summarize, "strongly-typed" means that types are enforced at compile time, reducing errors, while "not type-safe" implies that types are not enforced, potentially leading to runtime errors.

**34.** ==Overloading is a type of Compile time polymorphism and Overriding is a type of run time polymorphism==

**35.** ==An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants.==

**36.** ==Boxing is the process of converting from value type to reference type.==

**37.** ==Unboxing is the process of converting reference type to value type. Unboxing is explicit conversion process.==
