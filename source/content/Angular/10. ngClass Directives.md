**Definition of Directives?**  
Directives are classes that add or modify behavior in the DOM (Document Object Model) elements within the template.

> [!tip] 
> **What is DOM?**
> 
> Using the DOM, we can dynamically change the value or content of both `<p>` and `<h>` tags (or any other HTML elements). You can do this by selecting the element and modifying its properties, such as `textContent` or `innerHTML`.
> 
> `document.getElementById('myPara').textContent = 'New text!';`

**Purpose of Directives?**
Directives are used to manipulate the DOM, such as adding/removing elements or changing their appearance.

### ngClass Directive

The `ngClass` directive allows you to add or remove CSS classes dynamically.

- It is an **attribute directive** that binds CSS classes to HTML elements based on expressions.

---

### How to Use ngClass

- **1. String Expression**  
    You can bind a string directly to `ngClass` to apply one or more classes:
    
    ```html
    <h2 [ngClass]="'myColor myFont'">Test by MSA</h2>
    ```

- **2. Array Expression**  
    You can use an array to assign multiple classes:
    
    ```html
    <h2 [ngClass]="['myColor', 'myFont']">Test by MSA</h2>
    ```

- **3. Object Expression**  
    You can conditionally apply classes using an object, where the key is the class name and the value is a boolean:
    
    ```html
    <h2 [ngClass]="{'myColor': true}">Test by MSA</h2>
    ```

---

### Example Using Arrays and Objects

**Component (TS)**

```typescript
public myArray = ["myColor", "myWriting"];
public c = new MyClass();

constructor() {}

ngOnInit(): void {}
```

**Class Definition**

```typescript
class MyClass {
  myColor = true;
  myWriting = true;
}
```

**HTML**

```html
<h2 [ngClass]="myArray">Test by MSA</h2>
<h2 [ngClass]="myArray">Test by MSA</h2>
```

---

### ngClass Without Square Brackets

- If you use `ngClass` without square brackets, the expression is directly assigned to the class attribute (no evaluation).
- Remove the quotes around the expression:
    
    ```html
    <h2 ngClass='myColor myFont'>Test by MSA</h2>
    ```
