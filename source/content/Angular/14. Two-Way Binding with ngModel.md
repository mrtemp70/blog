**Two-Way Binding**

- **Class -> HTML + HTML -> Class**  
    With two-way binding, changes in the **class** (TypeScript) are reflected in the **HTML**, and changes in the **HTML** are reflected back to the **class**. Both the class and the view stay in sync.

### Example: Two-Way Binding

- **Component (TypeScript)**  
    The `name` property is defined in the component, and it's bound to the input field. Any change to the input will update the `name` property, and any change to `name` will update the input.
    
    ```typescript
    export class TwoWayComponent implements OnInit {
      public name = "Shoyeb";  // Property
    
      constructor() {}
    
      ngOnInit(): void {}
    }
    ```

- **HTML**  
    The `[(ngModel)]` directive binds the input field to the `name` property. The value of the input field will be automatically updated when the `name` changes, and vice versa.
    
    ```html
    <input [(ngModel)]="name" type="text">
    <h2>{{ name }}</h2>
    ```

### Important: Add `FormsModule` to `app.module.ts`

To enable two-way binding, you need to import `FormsModule` into the `app.module.ts`.

```typescript
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // components
  ],
  imports: [
    // other modules
    FormsModule  // Add this line
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Key Concepts:

- **`[(ngModel)]`**: This syntax is called **banana in a box** because of the `[( )]` brackets and parentheses, which represent both property binding and event binding in one.
    
- **Two-Way Binding**: The value of the input field and the property in the component (`name`) are bound together. Changes in one will reflect in the other automatically.
