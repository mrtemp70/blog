## Create New Project

1. Use `ng new project-name --standalone=false` (Here NgLab kind of project-name. AppModule will not be visible if standalone=true)

*Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? No*

> [!hint] 
> Using `standalone=false` <p align="justify"> in Angular keeps the traditional **NgModules** structure, which is compatible with older projects and third-party libraries. It provides a modular way to organize components, support lazy loading, and offer better control over configuration. This is helpful for larger applications where modules enhance maintainability. </p>

2. Then use `cd project-name` and `code .` 
3. Finally use `ng serve --o` for run (--o for browser open. Give permission for first time `set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`)
