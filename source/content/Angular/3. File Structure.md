1. When an Angular project runs, it first loads `index.html`, which contains the `<app-root></app-root>` tag. This tag is used to locate the root component of the application.
2. Next, it moves to `angular.json` and looks for the `"browser": "src/main.ts"` entry, then proceeds to `main.ts`.
3. In `main.ts`, the project bootstraps with `AppModule`, which is decorated with `@NgModule`. In `app.module.ts`, we can see various declarations and configurations within the NgModule.
4. Finally, the application initializes based on these modules and configurations.
