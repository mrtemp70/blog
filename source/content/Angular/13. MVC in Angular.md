**MVC** (Model-View-Controller) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing web applications. It separates the application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model**: Represents the data or business logic of the application.
2. **View**: Represents the UI, displaying the data.
3. **Controller**: Handles the input and updates the model and view.

### Example of MVC in Angular

- **Controller** (AppComponent)  
    The `AppComponent` acts as the controller. It defines the logic and binds data from the model to the view.
    
    ```typescript
    export class AppComponent {  // Controller
      title = "Tutorial";         // Model (title is a property here)
      name = "Shoyeb";            // Model (name is a property here)
    }
    ```
    
- **Model**  
    The `title` and `name` properties are part of the model, holding the data.
    
- **View** (app.component.html)  
    The HTML file is the view, where the data from the controller is displayed.
    
    ```html
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ name }}</p>
    ```

### Key Points:

- The **controller** (`AppComponent`) manages the data and updates the **view** (`app.component.html`).
- The **model** consists of properties like `title` and `name` in the component.
- The **view** is where the user sees the data, and it's updated when the model changes.
