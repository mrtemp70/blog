## Additional Properties

- **Z-index**: This is actually the same as the stack concept. Suppose in a box (positioned absolute/relative) there are 2 or 3 color boxes, then which color will be on top and which will be at the bottom can be solved via this `z-index`. `z-index:1` means top, `0` means bottom. More explanation: [link].
  
- **Order**: If there are arrays like a, b, c, d, e, and I set `order:1` for a, then the order will be b, c, d, e, a. Here b, c, d, e is `0` (not sorted), and a is `1` (sorted), which is why the sorted list will be shown last. If I set every element as order, my result will be shown as a, b, c, d, e (if there are any elements that are unordered or `order=1`, they will stay on top, followed by ordered elements).
